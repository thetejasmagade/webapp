            Some might look at that data and assume that front-end positions are
            better for entry-level devs because the salaries are lower. On the
            contrary! There is higher demand and lower supply for backend
            positions. With the right preparation a backend position can
            actually be easier to land.

          <p class="mb-4">
            With all that in mind, a computer science education is actually
            useful for all types of developers, we've just found that it's
            disproportionately useful to backend engineers.
